*On March 19, 2015, Facebook announced that everyone in the Philippines would now be able to access their site and app for free.*

<!--more-->
*Provided, of course, that these people's SIM cards came from FB's local telecommunications partner, Smart.*

*More than 3 years later, this Free FB promo has proven so successful that the company is now partnered with all major telecom networks in the country. Depending on your data plan, other apps such as Spotify, Youtube, Snapchat, and Skype can also be used "for free" as well.*

*Here’s some snapshots from my life of what that looks like.*

### I wake up, and there are 56 notifications on my phone.

50 of them are from the FB Messenger group of my mother's side of the family.

I don’t like Facebook. I try to use it as little as possible.

But the messages are all about my cousin’s kid. Apparently she’s now learning to stand, and she’s being very cute about it.

I decide to take a peek.

By the time I’m done looking at all the videos, pictures, messages, and links in the thread, it’s been half an hour, and I’m on the brink of getting to work late.

### I am late.

“I want to delete Facebook,” I say.

“Me too!” a coworker says. He goes on a long gripe about how much time he wastes scrolling through his Newsfeed everyday.

“Why don’t you just stop using it?” I ask.

“I can’t,” he says.

I understand.

### It’s breaktime, and I check my phone.

Another dozen notifications from Facebook. More cute pictures.

I decide not to look.

### It’s a few hours later.

I’m done with all the work I can do for the day, but it’s still too early to clock out because I got in late.

I’m bored.

There are new notifications on my phone. I dismiss them all. I don’t care if some girl from grade school I only talked to once is going to—Wait.

Did one of those notifications just say I got a message from my high school friends’ group?

I open Messenger. And I did get a message from an old friend. I reply, we chat for a while. Other friends from the group join in. By the time we’re done talking, the group has decided to meet up on Friday.

As I’m tucking my phone away, I wonder if anyone would have contacted me if Messenger wasn’t free.

### My boss has just told me we need freelancers for one of our projects.

I open Facebook to ask around if anyone’s interested. None of my friends are, but one of them knows a Facebook Group for Filipino freelancers.

I join. I post what I need to get done, and my inbox is flooded with dozens of inquiries about the job in a matter of minutes.

Why use job boards when you have this?

### It’s late, and the bosses have gone home.

Someone hooks up Spotify to the office speakers, and Youtube’s now ok to play. The time until I can get out passes by more quickly.

### It’s Friday, and my high school friends and I are at a mall.

We’re eating lunch, and they’re laughing about some meme that’s been circulating on Facebook.

I can’t relate.

I don’t look at my Newsfeed anymore, because I don’t like the effect browsing it has on me. I just look at direct messages now. It’s much better for me this way, but no Newsfeed means I’ve started missing out on a lot of things.

“What are you talking about?” I ask when they’re done laughing.

One of them is kind enough to explain the meme to me. I feel like a grandmother in a millenial’s body.

A few minutes later, they’re gossiping about a friend’s new boyfriend.
I didn’t even know she has a new boyfriend.

Am I a bad friend for not knowing? Or is she a bad friend for not telling me directly? Why should she have to though, when FB’s Newsfeed exists?

I don’t know anymore.

### In the middle of chatting with old friends, I look at my phone.

I’ve got a message from my brother. He’s living halfway around the world right now.

I’m so glad I don’t have to sell a kidney every time I want to talk to him. But I wonder how much Facebook is listening in.

### We’re looking at shoes.

I find a pair I like, and bring it to the counter.

It turns out I’ll get a discount if I share the store’s FB page on my timeline.

So I do. I break my several months long no posting streak.

The shoes are excellent. I consider it a good deal.

### The mall is closing.

My friends and I say our goodbyes.

My parents are picking me up from the mall. Unlike everyone else I know, they still communicate through text. I send them one to say I’m ready to go home.

The message doesn’t send.

I’m out of load. I can’t send any texts anymore, and I don’t have enough data to call a Grab. I’m all alone. The mall is closed. It’s dark and getting darker. I don’t have enough money for a taxi, and it’s not safe to get in one alone at this time of night anyway. And my phone’s battery is about to die.

Thank god for Free Facebook.

I contact my parents over Messenger for free. Twenty minutes later, their car’s idling right in front of me.

I get home safe.

### Another notification from a family group.

This time it’s about the latest criminal modus operandi.

Good to know, I guess. Or is this actually fake, and it’s just going to make me more afraid and suspicious of other people than I need to be?

### I’m lying on my bed, getting ready to sleep, and for the hundredth time I’m reevaluating my decision to minimize Facebook in my life.

The way I’m going, I’m missing out on a lot of things. I don't know what memes are current right now, what people think about national news, what’s going on with my friends’ lives. Everything’s on Facebook now. Maybe I’m even missing out on job opportunities by staying out of the mix like this.

Am I just substituting one headache for another?

I open Facebook. I scroll through my Newsfeed.

The first ten posts are full of advertisements, staged beach shots, and people sniping at each other over Duterte.

Yep.

I uninstall Facebook from my phone.

Maybe someday I’ll manage to delete my account too.
